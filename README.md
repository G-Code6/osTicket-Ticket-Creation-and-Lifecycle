<h3>1. Ticket Creation:</h3> 

- A ticket is created when a user submits a request for support or assistance. This can be done through various channels such as email, web form, or API.

<h3>2. Assignment:</h3>

- Once a ticket is created, it needs to be assigned to an agent or a team responsible for handling such requests. This can be done manually by an administrator or automatically based on predefined rules or round-robin assignment.
